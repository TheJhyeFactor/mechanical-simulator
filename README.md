# 3D Mechanical System Designer

An interactive educational tool for visualizing and testing mechanical assemblies with realistic 3D models and physics simulations.

## Overview

This project is a **3D mechanical design simulator** featuring two complete working systems:

### 1. Single-Barrel Shotgun Hammer System
- External hammer with L-shaped body
- Sear engagement mechanism
- Compression hammer spring
- Trigger linkage
- Receiver frame with trigger guard
- **Operation:** Cock hammer (70° rotation) → Fire (hammer falls forward)

### 2. Straight-Pull Bolt Action System
- Bolt body with handle and extractor
- Internal striker (firing pin)
- Sear catch mechanism
- Trigger bar connection
- Striker spring
- Full receiver with bolt raceway
- **Operation:** Pull bolt to cock striker → Fire (striker releases forward)

## Features

- **Full 3D Rendering** - Three.js-powered realistic visualization
- **Two Complete Systems** - Switch between shotgun and bolt action
- **Working Mechanics** - Cock and fire with realistic animations
- **Physics Calculations** - Spring force, velocity, impact energy
- **Stress Analysis** - Live stress bars and failure point detection
- **Camera Controls** - Orbit, pan, zoom, multiple view presets
- **Component Selection** - Click parts to inspect properties
- **Educational Disclaimer** - Clear abstract modeling notice

## Technical Implementation

Built with:
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- PBR materials (metalness, roughness)
- Realistic geometries for each component
- Smooth animation system
- Real-time physics calculations
- No backend required - runs entirely client-side

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This project is a conceptual interaction simulator for educational and visualization purposes only.**

This simulator:
- Does NOT represent real-world devices, measurements, materials, or operation
- Uses abstract states and relationships, not physical specifications
- Is purely for learning about state machines and constraint solving
- Should NOT be used as construction, modification, or operational guidance

All components, forces, and interactions are **conceptual abstractions** for educational demonstration.
