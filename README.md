# Mechanical Interaction Simulator

An interactive educational tool for visualizing state-based mechanical systems, constraint solving, and component interactions.

## Overview

This project is a **conceptual interaction simulator** that demonstrates:
- State machine logic
- Constraint satisfaction problems
- Component engagement rules
- Visual debugging of mechanical states
- Stress analysis and failure point detection

## Educational Purpose

Learn about:
- Boolean logic and state transitions
- Constraint-based systems (similar to CAD software)
- Physics simulation principles
- Engineering problem-solving
- System stability analysis

## Features

- **Interactive Component Manipulation** - Drag and position mechanical elements
- **Real-time State Visualization** - See state changes as they happen
- **Constraint Solver** - Automatic detection of valid/invalid configurations
- **Stress Analysis** - Identify points of failure and load distribution
- **Visual Feedback** - Clear indicators for engagement, blocking, and release states

## Technical Implementation

Built with:
- Vanilla JavaScript for state machine logic
- HTML5 Canvas for visualization
- CSS3 for modern UI
- No external dependencies

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This project is a conceptual interaction simulator for educational and visualization purposes only.**

This simulator:
- Does NOT represent real-world devices, measurements, materials, or operation
- Uses abstract states and relationships, not physical specifications
- Is purely for learning about state machines and constraint solving
- Should NOT be used as construction, modification, or operational guidance

All components, forces, and interactions are **conceptual abstractions** for educational demonstration.
